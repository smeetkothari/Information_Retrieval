------------------ The Code of the Geeks v1.0.1 --------------------------
----------------------     July 17, 1993    ------------------------------ 

So you think you are a geek, eh?  The first step is to admit to yourself
your geekiness.  No matter what anyone says, geeks are people too; geeks
have rights.  So take a deep breath and announce to the world that you are a
geek.  Your courage will give you strength that will last you forever.

How to tell the world you are a geek, you ask?  Use the universal Geek code. 
By joining the geek organization, you have license to use this special code
that will allow you to let other un-closeted geeks know who you are in a
simple, codified statement.

The single best way to announce your geekhood is to add your geek code to
signature file and announce it far and wide.  But be careful, you may give
other geeks the courage to come out of the closet.  You might want to hang
on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.

---------------------
INSTRUCTIONS:

query5
The geek code consists of several categories.  Each category is labeled with
a letter and some qualifiers.  Go through each category and determine which
set of qualifiers best describes you in that category.  By stringing all of
these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall geek code. 
It is this single line of code that will inform other geeks the world over
of what a great geek you actually are.

Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. 
Simply choose that qualifier that MOST CLOSELY matches you.  Also, some
activities described in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you
do engage in others.  Each description of each qualifier describes the wide
range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you can
probably use that qualifier.

----------------------

VARIABLES:
Geeks can seldom be quantified.  To facilitate the fact that within any
one category the geek may not be able determine a specific category,
variables have been designed to allow this range to be included.
