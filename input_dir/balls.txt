    Abstract:  Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit)

    Mouse balls are now available as FRU.  Therefore, if a mouse
    fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a
    ball replacement.  Because of the delicate nature of this
    procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by
    properly trained personnel.

    Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining
    the underside of the mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and
    harder than foreign balls.  Ball removal procedures differ
    depending upon manufacturer of the mouse.  Foreign balls can be
    replaced using the pop-off method.  Domestic balls are replaced
    using the twist-off method.  Mouse balls are not usually static
    sensitive.  However, excessive handling can result in sudden
    discharge.  Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be
    used immediately.

    It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls
    for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.  Any customer
    missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing
    these necessary items.
